# TensorFLow: Advanced Techniques Specialisation

I just finished DeepLearning.AI's advanced TensorFlow course through coursera. The specialisatoin is divided into four courses;

- Custom Models, Layers and Loss Functions with TensorFlow
- Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow
- Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow
- Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow

I'll go into more detail on each course below, give a few critiques, but I'll start with a brief overview of my experience with the course. 

Overall I enjoyed the course but found the second half a bit underwhelming. It brushed me up on some of the finer points of my core knowledge of TensorFlow, but didn't really teach me anything new. I think the course isn't as focsued as it should be, it feels like a mixutre of an introudciton to TensorFlow beyond the sequential API and an introductory deep learning course. 

The course can be found here: [TensorFlow: Advanced Techniques Specialisation](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-advanced-techniques?adgroupid=121113573337&adpostion=&campaignid=13433112712&creativeid=645461735227&device=c&devicemodel=&gclid=Cj0KCQjw2cWgBhDYARIsALggUhpN9AADSzcNtADCFnJ8jfsj621bj_qUw1DdPDcZuX4z4WLQt6g4AM4aAq-WEALw_wcB&hide_mobile_promo=&keyword=coursera%20%2B&matchtype=b&network=g&utm_campaign=04-CourseraPlus-ESC&utm_content=B2C&utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg).



## Custom Models, Layers and Loss Functions with TensorFlow

This was probably my favourite course in the specialization. It was closer to what I was looking for in terms of the inner working of TensorFlow rather than the applications. The course covered the following topics; Functional vs Sequential API, Custom losses, layers, models and callbacks. 

## Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow

Most of the distributed training felt supuflous, although some familiaryt with the basic TensorFLow objects for this is useful. The course covered the following topics; Differentiation and gradients with gradient tape, custom training loops, graph mode vs eagerm ode and dsitributed training strategies.

## Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow

I didn't love this course. It was a bit of a whirl-wind tour of using the techniques from course 1 and course 2 to build a few different models accross problems including segmentation, classification and object detection. It was a bit too applied for my taste, I was familiar with most of the concepts and if i'm going to spend time training models I would prefer to do it on my own projects. 


## Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow

I actually quite enjoyed this course despite it's similarities to course 3. It's pretty hard not to appreciate the results of the generative techniques we covered. It was broken down into four chunks: neural style transfer, which I had read the paper for but not implemented, autoencoders, variational autoencoders and GANs. 


# Critiques of the Specialization

I have three main criques on the course which I'll go into in more detail below. Topic choice andgamification of coursera.

My problem with the content, primarily in the latter courses, is that it wasn't very specific to TensorFlow. It  was more of a general introduction to deep learning and the techniques used in the field - with implementations in TensorFlow. I think for introductory courses this makes sense, trying to get the earner interested in the field and giving motivating examples. However, I think for a specialization it should be more specific to the framework, really digging into how things work. This would serve me better as a developer. 

The primary issue i've faced with all coursera work is the natural gamification of the platform. The videos, quizes and assignments, quizes are all relatively bite-sized and easy to consume. This is great for getting it done quickly, but it's not great for retaining information. I've found it difficult not to use just get the videos out of the way and smash out the assignment as quickly as possible. I think this is a problem with the platform, not the course. It's too tempting to just get the work done and move on. I think a more effective approach would be to have longer videos in a more lecture style format, with more content. THe assignments should be removed and replaced with longer quizes, including random sampling of questions to prevent brute forcing, limited retries, and short answer coding questions to really test understanding.
This format would create much more pressure on the learner, which is bound to give better results.
