# About

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer from New Zealand with a computer science background focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Victoria University of Wellington. Previously, I worked at an AI startup as a data scientist and machine learning engineer, utilizing deep computer vision to solve remote sensing segmentation problems. 

This blog is most likely going to be a collection of semi-finised, semi-written thoughts/results/reviews/notes. In the ideal world there will be some well written, polished content here, but I'm not making any promises. I'm going with the "write first, edit later" approach, and hoping to update old posts as I learn more, or have new bursts of inspiration. These posts will be part proof of work, part reference material, part writing practice, and part learning. 

I'm justifying this loose approach in that I am possibly the only person who will ever read this blog. For anyone that's not me; hello, welcome and apologies.
